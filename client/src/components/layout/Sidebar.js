					<p>
						Easterseals Run is a national fundraiser to support the work of Easterseals. For nearly
						100 years, Easterseals has been helping people with disabilities and their families,
						caregivers, veterans and seniors get the services and supports they need to reach their
						full potential.
					</p>
					<p>
						Individual walkers and teams join hundreds of other passionate people in their
						communities for a day full of entertainment, fun and, of course, our signature walk!
						Since 2003, over 230,000 people have participated in 615 Easterseals Run events
						nationwide generating nearly &#36;41 million to support families at Easterseals. This
						year, you can help Easterseals accomplish even more!
					</p>
					<p>
						Each participant's motivation to walk is unique; it may be for themselves, a child of a
						loved one, a neighbor or a colleague. 20&#37; of the US population lives with a
						disability today- like autism which has become a significant issue for too many
						families. We walk for them, their future and the families who love them. Easterseals Run
						to help people with disabilities live, learn, work and play.
					</p>
					<p>
						Every walk event is different -- your walk could be at a local school or at the
						aquarium! But every walk is a lifeline of funds that enables your local Easterseals to
						continue providing vital services and support to people with disabilities and their
						families.

					<h4 className='text-center'>How Your Money Helps</h4>
					<h5>Financial</h5>
					<p>
						Children with physical disabilities require costly equipment to meet basic needs, live
						safely, and strive for independence. The families of these children face not only
						personal sacrifice, but also a heavy financial burden. It can cost families more than
						&#36;40,000 a year to care for a child with a severe disability, and as children grow,
						equipment must be replaced. Government agencies cover only partial costs of certain
						pieces of equipment necessary to these children for personal safety, mobility, and
						communication, and for some pieces, not at all.
					</p>
					<p>
						Extra family expenses can include: home renovations, adaptive equipment and devices,
						special schooling, special transportation and adapted vehicles, time away from work for
						medical appointments and surgeries, plus the cost of care givers, to name a few.
					</p>
					<p>
						Of the families who requested financial assistance from Easter Seals and self-reported
						their annual income in 2016, 61&#37; reported a total family income under &#36;60,000.
						In addition, 45&#37; of families had a total annual household income under &#36;40,000;
						and 24&#37; had a total family income under &#36;20,000.
